Welcome to the **Fun**ctional Genomics **Lab**oratory at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). We are located in the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.utdallas.edu/biology/) in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. We study mechanisms of genome expression: transcription insulation, transcription elongation, enhancers, and long range chromosomal interactions.

If you are interested in pursuing your postbaccalaureate, graduate, or postdoctoral research training with us, please send a CV, letters of recommendation, and reprints of recent papers to [Dr. Tae Hoon Kim](mailto:genome@utdallas.edu) for consideration. If you are an undergraduate student at UTD, please submit your research interest application via a web form available [here](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/students/about).

Follow our laboratory's blog: [lablog](https://taehoonkim.org/news).
